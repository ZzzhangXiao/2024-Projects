This project involves utilising sales data from an e-commerce company, with an
objective of obtaining an accurate prediction using the training data and the test data
available. The data available includes various attributes related to the products, the
customers as well as the days. However, the sales column has been hidden in the test
data set for prediction purposes. Following this, an inventory decision would have to be
made and the objective is to maximise the profits induced from our inventory decision
model.
The report would first delve into the data exploration and pre-processing of the provided
datasets, as well as using various regression models and methodologies to derive the
best prediction model, through the tuning of the various hyperparameters as well as the
evaluation of the different regression models utilised. The derivation of the inventory
decision model would also be explained in the report.
